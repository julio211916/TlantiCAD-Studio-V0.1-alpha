# Gateway Operations

The gateway daemon is the always-on pi session that receives events from Inngest functions, Telegram, and webhooks. It's the system's notification and communication layer.

**Rule: Always use `joelclaw gateway` CLI. Never use `launchctl`, `curl`, or log file grep directly.**

## CLI Commands

```bash
joelclaw gateway status    # Daemon availability, runtime mode, session pressure, Redis health
joelclaw gateway restart   # Roll daemon, clean Redis, fresh session
joelclaw gateway enable    # Re-enable launch agent + start daemon
joelclaw gateway test      # Push test event, verify delivery (Redis bridge path)
joelclaw gateway push --type <type> [--payload JSON]  # Push an event to all sessions
joelclaw gateway events    # Peek at pending events per session
joelclaw gateway drain     # Clear all event queues
joelclaw gateway stream    # NDJSON stream of all gateway events (ADR-0058)
joelclaw gateway behavior {add|list|promote|remove|apply|stats}  # ADR-0211 behavior control plane
```

`joelclaw gateway restart` is the canonical restart. It kills the process, cleans Redis state, re-enables `com.joel.gateway` if launchd disabled it, waits for launchd to respawn, and verifies the new session. `joelclaw gateway enable` is the direct recovery path when launchd drift disabled the service. Never use `launchctl bootout/bootstrap` directly.

## Quick Triage

Substrate precheck first (avoid chasing secondary gateway symptoms):

```bash
colima status --json
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -n joelclaw redis-0 inngest-0
```

If Colima is down or node/core pods are not healthy, recover substrate before gateway operations.

Run in order, stop at first failure:

```bash
joelclaw gateway status    # 1. Is it alive? Sessions registered?
joelclaw gateway test      # 2. Can events flow end-to-end?
joelclaw gateway events    # 3. Are events piling up? (backpressure)
joelclaw gateway restart   # 4. If stuck, restart
```

If `joelclaw gateway status` shows pending > 0 on sessions, the agent is mid-stream or stuck. If it persists after a minute, restart.

## Redis-degraded mode (ADR-0214)

`joelclaw gateway status` now distinguishes:

- `mode: normal` — Redis bridge healthy
- `mode: redis_degraded` — daemon/channels/session available, but Redis-backed capabilities are degraded

When `mode=redis_degraded`:

- direct human conversation can still work
- Redis-backed commands/inspections are only partially trustworthy
- `joelclaw gateway test` validates the Redis bridge path, so expect `joelclaw gateway diagnose` to skip that layer intentionally
- use `joelclaw gateway diagnose` to see the degraded capability list and session pressure fields

Do not report `redis_degraded` as “gateway down” unless process/session health is also failing.

## Gateway context refresh scoping (ADR-0204)

Gateway rolling context refresh is useful only when it stays scoped.

Hard rule:
- do **not** treat automated digests, gateway event wrappers, recovery summaries, or terse acknowledgements as recall seeds
- if there is no real conversational topic, skip refresh rather than querying generic global memory

Why:
- a bad hidden `context-refresh` injection poisons the live gateway session even when `joelclaw gateway status` still reports healthy
- this showed up as unrelated voice/livekit notes bleeding into the gateway transcript

If Joel says the gateway session feels "fucked" while health checks look green, inspect the gateway session transcript for hidden `context-refresh` / `gateway-recovery` / `memory-recall` messages before trusting the CLI summary.

## Session pressure visibility (ADR-0218 rank 3 slice)

`joelclaw gateway status` / `joelclaw gateway diagnose` now expose session-pressure specifics instead of just a coarse health word:

- context usage % + next action
- next threshold summary (`compact at 65% ...` / `rotate at 75% ...` / `rotate immediately`)
- last compaction age + session age
- thread counts (`active` / `warm` / `total`)
- fallback state + activation count + consecutive prompt failures
- pressure reasons (`context_usage`, `context_ceiling`, `compaction_gap`, `session_age`)
- last alert health/time + cooldown state

The daemon emits OTEL under `daemon.session-pressure` (`session_pressure.alert.sent|suppressed|failed`). Operator paging is stricter now: only `critical` pressure states page Telegram, while `elevated` / `recovered` transitions stay in status/diagnose/OTEL.

Idle maintenance is autonomous for time-based pressure:
- watchdog evaluates idle session pressure even when no turn is active
- overdue compaction gaps trigger autonomous compaction instead of waiting for the next human/event turn
- age-triggered rotation can also happen from the watchdog path, seeding the fresh session with the compression summary before the next inbound turn
- those watchdog-triggered runs emit the same `daemon.maintenance.started|completed|failed` telemetry as turn-bound maintenance

## Interruptibility and supersession (ADR-0196 / ADR-0218 rank 4 slice)

For direct human turns across Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and Slack invoke paths, the latest message now wins.

Runtime contract:

- new human turns get a short `1.5s` batching window before dispatch
- batching is per source, so rapid follow-ups collapse into one queued prompt
- if that source is already active, gateway supersedes immediately instead of waiting on the timer
- stale queued prompts from that source are dropped
- durable queue replay must not self-drop the freshest human message; supersession only applies when a genuinely newer same-source message exists
- daemon requests `session.abort()` on the stale turn
- stale response text is suppressed instead of being delivered late
- `joelclaw gateway status` exposes `supersession` plus `supersession.batching`
- `joelclaw gateway diagnose` adds an `interruptibility` layer with supersession and batching details

Passive intel / background event routes are excluded from this path.

## Operator ack/timeout tracing (ADR-0218 rank 5 slice)

Telegram operator actions now get trace ids and explicit lifecycle tracking.

Current covered paths:
- `cmd:*` command-menu callbacks
- `worktree:*` callbacks
- `pitch:*` ADR pitch callbacks
- default Telegram callback actions and external callback-route handoffs
- direct Telegram slash commands registered through the command handler
- native Telegram `/stop`, `/esc`, and `/kill` commands

Gateway now tracks `kind=callback|command` plus ack/dispatched/completed/failed/timed_out state for those paths, exposes canonical `operatorTracing` in `joelclaw gateway status` (with `callbackTracing` kept as a compatibility alias), and adds an `operator-tracing` layer in `joelclaw gateway diagnose`.

Queued Telegram agent commands now keep their trace id through downstream gateway execution, complete on the real turn completion path, and fail on prompt error / assistant error / supersession instead of lying at enqueue time. Agent-backed command traces use a longer timeout window than simple callback ack paths.

External callback routes now have a Redis trace-result handoff too: the gateway leaves routed callbacks active, downstream consumers can publish `completed` / `failed` back with the same `traceId`, and the in-tree Restate Telegram route is wired to close traces on real downstream resolution.

Still open: any out-of-tree external callback consumer that doesn't adopt the handoff will still timeout as untracked work.

## Channel runtime contracts (ADR-0218 rank 6 slice)

`joelclaw gateway status` now exposes a canonical `channels` surface plus summarized `channelHealth` for Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and Slack. `joelclaw gateway diagnose` adds a `channel-health` layer so owner/passive/fallback and half-dead channel states are visible before a full outage.

Current rank-6 behavior also sends immediate degrade/recover alerts from the daemon, emits OTEL under `daemon.channel-health`, respects `joelclaw gateway known-issues` mute state so known flaky channels stop crying wolf, and now tracks guarded heal policy state per channel.

`channelHealth.healing` now shows restart/manual policy, degraded streaks, cooldown, attempt counts, last result, plus `manualRepairRequired`, `manualRepairSummary`, and `manualRepairCommands` when the watchdog cannot fix the channel itself. `gateway diagnose` adds `channel-healing`, spells out manual operator repair steps, and the watchdog can attempt guarded restarts for restart-eligible degraded channels while leaving ownership/lease conflicts as manual/operator work.

Telegram retrying `getUpdates` conflicts no longer read as healthy fallback: when polling is down and only retrying, the ownership contract degrades visibly in `/health`, `gateway status`, and `gateway diagnose`.

Low-signal operator-spam guardrails now also apply:
- treat `restate` / `restate/*` sources as automation for batching, so successful queue-dispatch DAG completions don’t hit the live gateway session immediately
- suppress `test.gateway-e2e` from operator delivery by default
- route Joel Slack passive intel through the canonical Redis signal pipeline (`slack.signal.received`) instead of bypassing relay policy
- use `packages/gateway/src/operator-relay.ts` as the single heuristics surface for normalize → score → correlate → route across Slack/email signals
- ingest `vip.email.received` after the VIP pipeline delivers its direct Telegram brief so the gateway keeps correlation context without sending a duplicate alert, while allowing lower-signal email/Slack items to batch into a correlated digest by project/contact/conversation keys
- drop low-signal-only digests (heartbeat-only / queue-dispatch-complete-only) instead of prompting the model for a pointless `HEARTBEAT_OK`
- routine fallback swap/recovery notices are not operator-facing during quiet hours, and recovery notices are log/OTEL-only unless some higher-signal path escalates them
- suppress direct operator-only `Knowledge Watchdog Alert` messages during quiet hours
- add proactive-compaction hysteresis (30m cooldown unless context meaningfully worsens)
- require a minimum dwell on fallback before probing primary again, so fallback swap→restore chatter doesn’t flap immediately
- when the primary model is `claude-opus-4-6`, floor `fallbackTimeoutMs` to `240000`; `120000` is now treated as stale and too aggressive for real Opus TTFT
- clear fallback timeout state immediately on empty/aborted `message_end` events so aborted turns cannot poison the next turn's latency/fallback monitoring
- emit structured fallback decision telemetry (`model_fallback.decision`) with reason buckets / probe counts / probe backoff so OTEL can separate real provider sickness from a noisy control loop
- back off primary recovery probes after transient/persistent probe failures instead of hammering the same sick provider every interval
- treat compaction/rotation as explicit maintenance windows: surface them in gateway status, emit maintenance lifecycle telemetry, and let idle-wait/watchdog logic extend for genuine maintenance work before declaring the turn dead

Muted degraded channels now also flip to `manual` with the known-issue reason surfaced as repair guidance, instead of falsely advertising a restart policy that the watchdog will skip while muted.

Still not done: stricter cross-channel ownership enforcement and richer/native repair automation beyond CLI-guided manual steps.

## Runtime guardrail enforcement (ADR-0189)

Gateway runtime now enforces two operator-visible guardrails:

1. **Tool-budget checkpoint tripwire**
   - channel turns: forced checkpoint after the 2-tool budget is exceeded
   - internal/background turns: forced checkpoint after the 4-tool budget is exceeded
   - telemetry: `daemon.guardrails:guardrail.checkpoint.*`
2. **Automatic post-push deploy verification**
   - after successful `git push` where `HEAD` touched `apps/web/` or root config (`turbo.json`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
   - daemon schedules `vercel ls --yes 2>&1 | head -10` after ~75s
   - failures alert Telegram and emit `daemon.guardrails:guardrail.deploy_verification.failed`

Use `joelclaw gateway status` to inspect live `guardrails` state, and `joelclaw gateway diagnose` when a checkpoint or deploy verification is active.

## Behavior Control Plane (ADR-0211)

Gateway behavior is now explicit + deterministic:

- **Runtime authority:** Redis active contract (`joelclaw:gateway:behavior:contract`)
- **History/candidates:** Typesense `gateway_behavior_history`
- **Write authority:** CLI only (`joelclaw gateway behavior ...`)

Operator directives can be entered directly via CLI or in-channel using strict syntax:

- `KEEP: ...`
- `MORE: ...`
- `LESS: ...`
- `STOP: ...`
- `START: ...`

Gateway extension passively captures those lines and shells to `joelclaw gateway behavior add ...`.
It does not write Redis or Typesense directly.

Daily review is advisory-only: candidates are generated by cron and must be promoted manually via `joelclaw gateway behavior promote --id <candidate-id>`.

## Sending Events from Inngest Functions

Every Inngest function receives `gateway` via middleware (ADR-0035):

```typescript
async ({ event, step, ...rest }) => {
  const gateway = (rest as any).gateway as GatewayContext | undefined;

  await step.run("notify", async () => {
    if (!gateway) return;
    await gateway.notify("my.event.type", {
      message: "Human-readable summary",
      data: "structured-payload",
    });
  });
}
```

| Method | Purpose | Routing |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `gateway.progress(msg, extra?)` | Pipeline/loop progress | Origin session + central gateway |
| `gateway.notify(type, payload?)` | Notifications (task done, webhook) | Origin session + central gateway |
| `gateway.alert(msg, extra?)` | System warnings (disk, service down) | Central gateway only |

Import: `import type { GatewayContext } from "../middleware/gateway";`

Always null-check `gateway` — functions can run without a gateway session.

## Low-Level: pushGatewayEvent()

For code outside the middleware:

```typescript
import { pushGatewayEvent } from "./agent-loop/utils";

await pushGatewayEvent({
  type: "video.downloaded",
  source: "inngest/video-download",
  payload: { message: "Downloaded: My Talk" },
  originSession: event.data.originSession,
});
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Status shows healthy but messages don't arrive | Session stuck mid-stream on hung tool call | `joelclaw gateway restart` |
| Pending events growing on a session | Agent processing or blocked | Wait 1min, then `joelclaw gateway restart` |
| Telegram messages not delivered | HTML parsing error in response | Check `joelclaw gateway status`, restart |
| Slack passive firehose looks dead (mentions still work) | `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_ID` not derived at startup | Ensure `slack_user_token` lease works; `gateway-start.sh` derives user id via `auth.test`, then `joelclaw gateway restart` |
| Slack replies have no default target | `SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID` not derived at startup | Ensure `slack_bot_token` lease works; `gateway-start.sh` derives DM channel via `conversations.open`, then restart |
| Gateway restarts every few seconds | Crash loop — bad secret lease or code error | Check `/tmp/joelclaw/gateway.err`, fix cause |
| Redis connection failed | Redis pod down or Colima/k8s substrate down | Check `colima status --json`, then `joelclaw status`/`kubectl` for cluster health |
| `langfuse-cost` optional dependency warning | Langfuse tracing dependency missing for pi extension runtime | Observability degradation only; do not treat as message-path blocker |

## Architecture

```
launchd (com.joel.gateway)
  └─ gateway-start.sh (leases secrets, sets env)
       └─ bun run daemon.ts
            ├─ createAgentSession() → headless pi session (reads SOUL.md)
            ├─ Redis channel (joelclaw:notify:gateway)
            ├─ Telegram channel (@JoelClawPandaBot)
            ├─ WebSocket (port 3018, for TUI attach)
            ├─ Command queue (serial — one prompt at a time)
            └─ Heartbeat runner (periodic autonomous checks)
```

The gateway reads `~/.pi/agent/` at boot for identity/prompt context (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, daily log), but the **gateway extension itself is context-local**:

- Canonical source: `~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/pi/extensions/gateway/index.ts`
- Active path: `~/.joelclaw/gateway/.pi/extensions/gateway` (symlink)
- Do **not** install/restore `~/.pi/agent/extensions/gateway` globally

Daemon startup enforces this invariant and will fail if local extension is missing or a global gateway extension is detected.

This keeps gateway automation hooks out of normal interactive pi sessions.
